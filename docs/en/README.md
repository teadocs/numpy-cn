    <h2>What is NumPy?</h2>
    <p>
      NumPy is the basic package for scientific computing using Python. Among other things, it includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A powerful N-dimensional array of objects.
      </li>
      <li>
        Precision broadcast function.
      </li>
      <li>
        A tool that integrates C/C+ and Fortran code.
      </li>
      <li>
        Powerful linear algebra, Fourier transform and random number functions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Ndarray?</h2>
    <p>One of the most important features of NumPy is its N-dimensional array object, ndarray, which is a collection of data of the same type, starting with an index of the elements in the collection with a 0 subscript. A ndarray object is a multidimensional array used to hold elements of the same type. Each element in ndarray has an area of the same storage size in memory.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h2>Slice and index</h2>
    <p>The contents of a ndarray object can be accessed and modified by indexing or slicing, just like the slicing of a list in Python. Ndarray arrays can be indexed based on 0 - n subscripts. Slice objects can be cut from the original array by using the built-in slice function and setting the start, stop and step parameters.</p>

### As Easy as 1, 2, 3

``` bash
# 1. installation package
$ pip install numpy

# 2. enter python's interactive interface
$ python -i

# 3. Use Numpy
>>> from numpy import *
>>> eye(4)

# 4. Output result
array([[1., 0., 0., 0.],
       [0., 1., 0., 0.],
       [0., 0., 1., 0.],
       [0., 0., 0., 1.]])
```
