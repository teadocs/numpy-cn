# Python类型和C结构

C代码中定义了几个新类型。其中大部分可以从Python访问，但有一些由于使用有限而未公开。
每种新的Python类型都有一个关联的 [``PyObject *``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) 和一个内部结构，该内部结构包括一个指向“方法表”的指针，该“方法表”定义了新对象在Python中的行为方式。当您将Python对象接收到C代码中时，您总是获得指向 [``PyObject``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) 结构的指针。因为  [``PyObject``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) 结构非常通用，并且只定义了[``PyObject_HEAD``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_HEAD)，所以它本身并不是很有趣。但是，不同的对象在 [``PyObject_HEAD``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject_HEAD) 之后包含更多细节(但是您必须强制转换为正确的类型才能访问它们-或者使用访问器函数或宏)。

## 定义了新的Python类型

Python types are the functional equivalent in C of classes in Python.
By constructing a new Python type you make available a new object for
Python. The ndarray object is an example of a new type defined in C.
New types are defined in C by two basic steps:

1. creating a C-structure (usually named ``Py{Name}Object``) that is
binary- compatible with the [``PyObject``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) structure itself but holds
the additional information needed for that particular object;
1. populating the [``PyTypeObject``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/type.html#c.PyTypeObject) table (pointed to by the ob_type
member of the [``PyObject``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) structure) with pointers to functions
that implement the desired behavior for the type.

Instead of special method names which define behavior for Python
classes, there are “function tables” which point to functions that
implement the desired results. Since Python 2.2, the PyTypeObject
itself has become dynamic which allows C types that can be “sub-typed
“from other C-types in C, and sub-classed in Python. The children
types inherit the attributes and methods from their parent(s).

There are two major new types: the ndarray ( [``PyArray_Type``](#c.PyArray_Type) )
and the ufunc ( [``PyUFunc_Type``](#c.PyUFunc_Type) ). Additional types play a
supportive role: the [``PyArrayIter_Type``](#c.PyArrayIter_Type), the
[``PyArrayMultiIter_Type``](#c.PyArrayMultiIter_Type), and the [``PyArrayDescr_Type``](#c.PyArrayDescr_Type)
. The [``PyArrayIter_Type``](#c.PyArrayIter_Type) is the type for a flat iterator for an
ndarray (the object that is returned when getting the flat
attribute). The [``PyArrayMultiIter_Type``](#c.PyArrayMultiIter_Type) is the type of the
object returned when calling ``broadcast`` (). It handles iteration
and broadcasting over a collection of nested sequences. Also, the
[``PyArrayDescr_Type``](#c.PyArrayDescr_Type) is the data-type-descriptor type whose
instances describe the data.  Finally, there are 21 new scalar-array
types which are new Python scalars corresponding to each of the
fundamental data types available for arrays. An additional 10 other
types are place holders that allow the array scalars to fit into a
hierarchy of actual Python types.

### PyArray_Type and PyArrayObject

- ``PyArray_Type``

    The Python type of the ndarray is [``PyArray_Type``](#c.PyArray_Type). In C, every
    ndarray is a pointer to a [``PyArrayObject``](#c.PyArrayObject) structure. The ob_type
    member of this structure contains a pointer to the [``PyArray_Type``](#c.PyArray_Type)
    typeobject.

- ``PyArrayObject``

    The [``PyArrayObject``](#c.PyArrayObject) C-structure contains all of the required
    information for an array. All instances of an ndarray (and its
    subclasses) will have this structure.  For future compatibility,
    these structure members should normally be accessed using the
    provided macros. If you need a shorter name, then you can make use
    of ``NPY_AO`` (deprecated) which is defined to be equivalent to
    [``PyArrayObject``](#c.PyArrayObject). Direct access to the struct fields are
    deprecated. Use the *PyArray_*(arr)* form instead.

    ``` c
    typedef struct PyArrayObject {
        PyObject_HEAD
        char *data;
        int nd;
        npy_intp *dimensions;
        npy_intp *strides;
        PyObject *base;
        PyArray_Descr *descr;
        int flags;
        PyObject *weakreflist;
    } PyArrayObject;
    ```

- ``PyArrayObject.PyObject_HEAD``

    This is needed by all Python objects. It consists of (at least)
    a reference count member ( ``ob_refcnt`` ) and a pointer to the
    typeobject ( ``ob_type`` ). (Other elements may also be present
    if Python was compiled with special options see
    Include/object.h in the Python source tree for more
    information). The ob_type member points to a Python type
    object.

- char *``PyArrayObject.data``

    Accessible via [``PyArray_DATA``](array.html#c.PyArray_DATA), this data member is a
    pointer to the first element of the array. This pointer can
    (and normally should) be recast to the data type of the array.

- int ``PyArrayObject.nd``

    An integer providing the number of dimensions for this
    array. When nd is 0, the array is sometimes called a rank-0
    array. Such arrays have undefined dimensions and strides and
    cannot be accessed. Macro [``PyArray_NDIM``](array.html#c.PyArray_NDIM) defined in
    ``ndarraytypes.h`` points to this data member. [``NPY_MAXDIMS``](array.html#c.NPY_MAXDIMS)
    is the largest number of dimensions for any array.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) ``PyArrayObject.dimensions``

    An array of integers providing the shape in each dimension as
    long as nd  1. The integer is always large enough
    to hold a pointer on the platform, so the dimension size is
    only limited by memory. [``PyArray_DIMS``](array.html#c.PyArray_DIMS) is the macro
    associated with this data member.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayObject.strides``

    An array of integers providing for each dimension the number of
    bytes that must be skipped to get to the next element in that
    dimension. Associated with macro [``PyArray_STRIDES``](array.html#c.PyArray_STRIDES).

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArrayObject.base``

    Pointed to by [``PyArray_BASE``](array.html#c.PyArray_BASE), this member is used to hold a
    pointer to another Python object that is related to this array.
    There are two use cases:

    - If this array does not own its own memory, then base points to the
    Python object that owns it (perhaps another array object)
    - If this array has the (deprecated) [``NPY_ARRAY_UPDATEIFCOPY``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_UPDATEIFCOPY) or
    [``NPY_ARRAY_WRITEBACKIFCOPY``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_WRITEBACKIFCOPY) flag set, then this array is a working
    copy of a “misbehaved” array.

    When ``PyArray_ResolveWritebackIfCopy`` is called, the array pointed to
    by base will be updated with the contents of this array.

- [PyArray_Descr](#c.PyArray_Descr) *``PyArrayObject.descr``

    A pointer to a data-type descriptor object (see below). The
    data-type descriptor object is an instance of a new built-in
    type which allows a generic description of memory. There is a
    descriptor structure for each data type supported. This
    descriptor structure contains useful information about the type
    as well as a pointer to a table of function pointers to
    implement specific functionality. As the name suggests, it is
    associated with the macro [``PyArray_DESCR``](array.html#c.PyArray_DESCR).

- int ``PyArrayObject.flags``

    Pointed to by the macro [``PyArray_FLAGS``](array.html#c.PyArray_FLAGS), this data member represents
    the flags indicating how the memory pointed to by data is to be
    interpreted. Possible flags are [``NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS),
    [``NPY_ARRAY_F_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_F_CONTIGUOUS), [``NPY_ARRAY_OWNDATA``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_OWNDATA),
    [``NPY_ARRAY_ALIGNED``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_ALIGNED), [``NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE),
    [``NPY_ARRAY_WRITEBACKIFCOPY``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_WRITEBACKIFCOPY), and [``NPY_ARRAY_UPDATEIFCOPY``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_UPDATEIFCOPY).

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArrayObject.weakreflist``

    This member allows array objects to have weak references (using the
    weakref module).

### PyArrayDescr_Type and PyArray_Descr

- ``PyArrayDescr_Type``

    The [``PyArrayDescr_Type``](#c.PyArrayDescr_Type) is the built-in type of the
    data-type-descriptor objects used to describe how the bytes comprising
    the array are to be interpreted.  There are 21 statically-defined
    [``PyArray_Descr``](#c.PyArray_Descr) objects for the built-in data-types. While these
    participate in reference counting, their reference count should never
    reach zero.  There is also a dynamic table of user-defined
    [``PyArray_Descr``](#c.PyArray_Descr) objects that is also maintained. Once a
    data-type-descriptor object is “registered” it should never be
    deallocated either. The function [``PyArray_DescrFromType``](array.html#c.PyArray_DescrFromType) (…) can
    be used to retrieve a [``PyArray_Descr``](#c.PyArray_Descr) object from an enumerated
    type-number (either built-in or user- defined).

- ``PyArray_Descr``

    The [``PyArray_Descr``](#c.PyArray_Descr) structure lies at the heart of the
    [``PyArrayDescr_Type``](#c.PyArrayDescr_Type). While it is described here for
    completeness, it should be considered internal to NumPy and manipulated via
    ``PyArrayDescr_*`` or ``PyDataType*`` functions and macros. The size of this
    structure is subject to change across versions of NumPy. To ensure
    compatibility:

    - Never declare a non-pointer instance of the struct
    - Never perform pointer arithmatic
    - Never use ``sizof(PyArray_Descr)``

    It has the following structure:

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyObject_HEAD
        PyTypeObject *typeobj;
        char kind;
        char type;
        char byteorder;
        char flags;
        int type_num;
        int elsize;
        int alignment;
        PyArray_ArrayDescr *subarray;
        PyObject *fields;
        PyObject *names;
        PyArray_ArrFuncs *f;
        PyObject *metadata;
        NpyAuxData *c_metadata;
        npy_hash_t hash;
    } PyArray_Descr;
    ```

- [PyTypeObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/type.html#c.PyTypeObject) *``PyArray_Descr.typeobj``

    Pointer to a typeobject that is the corresponding Python type for
    the elements of this array. For the builtin types, this points to
    the corresponding array scalar. For user-defined types, this
    should point to a user-defined typeobject. This typeobject can
    either inherit from array scalars or not. If it does not inherit
    from array scalars, then the [``NPY_USE_GETITEM``](#c.NPY_USE_GETITEM) and
    [``NPY_USE_SETITEM``](#c.NPY_USE_SETITEM) flags should be set in the ``flags`` member.

- char ``PyArray_Descr.kind``

    A character code indicating the kind of array (using the array
    interface typestring notation). A ‘b’ represents Boolean, a ‘i’
    represents signed integer, a ‘u’ represents unsigned integer, ‘f’
    represents floating point, ‘c’ represents complex floating point, ‘S’
    represents 8-bit zero-terminated bytes, ‘U’ represents 32-bit/character
    unicode string, and ‘V’ represents arbitrary.

- char ``PyArray_Descr.type``

    A traditional character code indicating the data type.

- char ``PyArray_Descr.byteorder``

    A character indicating the byte-order: ‘>’ (big-endian), ‘<’ (little-
    endian), ‘=’ (native), ‘|’ (irrelevant, ignore). All builtin data-
    types have byteorder ‘=’.

- char ``PyArray_Descr.flags``

    A data-type bit-flag that determines if the data-type exhibits object-
    array like behavior. Each bit in this member is a flag which are named
    as:

- ``NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT``

    Indicates that items of this data-type must be reference
    counted (using [``Py_INCREF``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_INCREF) and [``Py_DECREF``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/refcounting.html#c.Py_DECREF) ).

- ``NPY_ITEM_HASOBJECT``

    Same as [``NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT``](#c.NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT).

- ``NPY_LIST_PICKLE``

    Indicates arrays of this data-type must be converted to a list
    before pickling.

- ``NPY_ITEM_IS_POINTER``

    Indicates the item is a pointer to some other data-type

- ``NPY_NEEDS_INIT``

    Indicates memory for this data-type must be initialized (set
    to 0) on creation.

- ``NPY_NEEDS_PYAPI``

    Indicates this data-type requires the Python C-API during
    access (so don’t give up the GIL if array access is going to
    be needed).

- ``NPY_USE_GETITEM``

    On array access use the ``f->getitem`` function pointer
    instead of the standard conversion to an array scalar. Must
    use if you don’t define an array scalar to go along with
    the data-type.

- ``NPY_USE_SETITEM``

    When creating a 0-d array from an array scalar use
    ``f->setitem`` instead of the standard copy from an array
    scalar. Must use if you don’t define an array scalar to go
    along with the data-type.

- ``NPY_FROM_FIELDS``

    The bits that are inherited for the parent data-type if these
    bits are set in any field of the data-type. Currently (
    [``NPY_NEEDS_INIT``](#c.NPY_NEEDS_INIT) | [``NPY_LIST_PICKLE``](#c.NPY_LIST_PICKLE) |
    [``NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT``](#c.NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT) | [``NPY_NEEDS_PYAPI``](#c.NPY_NEEDS_PYAPI) ).

- ``NPY_OBJECT_DTYPE_FLAGS``

    Bits set for the object data-type: ( [``NPY_LIST_PICKLE``](#c.NPY_LIST_PICKLE)
    | [``NPY_USE_GETITEM``](#c.NPY_USE_GETITEM) | [``NPY_ITEM_IS_POINTER``](#c.NPY_ITEM_IS_POINTER) |
    ``NPY_REFCOUNT`` | [``NPY_NEEDS_INIT``](#c.NPY_NEEDS_INIT) |
    [``NPY_NEEDS_PYAPI``](#c.NPY_NEEDS_PYAPI)).

- ``PyDataType_FLAGCHK``([PyArray_Descr](#c.PyArray_Descr)* *dtype*, int* flags*)

    Return true if all the given flags are set for the data-type
    object.

- ``PyDataType_REFCHK``([PyArray_Descr](#c.PyArray_Descr)* *dtype*)

    Equivalent to [``PyDataType_FLAGCHK``](#c.PyDataType_FLAGCHK) (*dtype*,
    [``NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT``](#c.NPY_ITEM_REFCOUNT)).

- int ``PyArray_Descr.type_num``

    A number that uniquely identifies the data type. For new data-types,
    this number is assigned when the data-type is registered.

- int ``PyArray_Descr.elsize``

    For data types that are always the same size (such as long), this
    holds the size of the data type. For flexible data types where
    different arrays can have a different elementsize, this should be
    0.

- int ``PyArray_Descr.alignment``

    A number providing alignment information for this data type.
    Specifically, it shows how far from the start of a 2-element
    structure (whose first element is a ``char`` ), the compiler
    places an item of this type: ``offsetof(struct {char c; type v;},
    v)``

- PyArray_ArrayDescr *``PyArray_Descr.subarray``

    If this is non- ``NULL``, then this data-type descriptor is a
    C-style contiguous array of another data-type descriptor. In
    other-words, each element that this descriptor describes is
    actually an array of some other base descriptor. This is most
    useful as the data-type descriptor for a field in another
    data-type descriptor. The fields member should be ``NULL`` if this
    is non- ``NULL`` (the fields member of the base descriptor can be
    non- ``NULL`` however). The ``PyArray_ArrayDescr`` structure is
    defined using

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyArray_Descr *base;
        PyObject *shape;
    } PyArray_ArrayDescr;
    ```

    The elements of this structure are:

- [PyArray_Descr](#c.PyArray_Descr) *``PyArray_ArrayDescr.base``

    The data-type-descriptor object of the base-type.

    [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArray_ArrayDescr.shape``[¶](#c.PyArray_ArrayDescr.shape)

    The shape (always C-style contiguous) of the sub-array as a Python
    tuple.

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArray_Descr.fields``

    If this is non-NULL, then this data-type-descriptor has fields
    described by a Python dictionary whose keys are names (and also
    titles if given) and whose values are tuples that describe the
    fields. Recall that a data-type-descriptor always describes a
    fixed-length set of bytes. A field is a named sub-region of that
    total, fixed-length collection. A field is described by a tuple
    composed of another data- type-descriptor and a byte
    offset. Optionally, the tuple may contain a title which is
    normally a Python string. These tuples are placed in this
    dictionary keyed by name (and also title if given).

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArray_Descr.names``

    An ordered tuple of field names. It is NULL if no field is
    defined.

- [PyArray_ArrFuncs](#c.PyArray_ArrFuncs) *``PyArray_Descr.f``

    A pointer to a structure containing functions that the type needs
    to implement internal features. These functions are not the same
    thing as the universal functions (ufuncs) described later. Their
    signatures can vary arbitrarily.

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArray_Descr.metadata``

    Metadata about this dtype.

- [NpyAuxData](array.html#c.NpyAuxData) *``PyArray_Descr.c_metadata``

    Metadata specific to the C implementation
    of the particular dtype. Added for NumPy 1.7.0.

- Npy_hash_t *``PyArray_Descr.hash``

    Currently unused. Reserved for future use in caching
    hash values.

- ``PyArray_ArrFuncs``

    Functions implementing internal features. Not all of these
    function pointers must be defined for a given type. The required
    members are ``nonzero``, ``copyswap``, ``copyswapn``, ``setitem``,
    ``getitem``, and ``cast``. These are assumed to be non- ``NULL``
    and ``NULL`` entries will cause a program crash. The other
    functions may be ``NULL`` which will just mean reduced
    functionality for that data-type. (Also, the nonzero function will
    be filled in with a default function if it is ``NULL`` when you
    register a user-defined data-type).

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyArray_VectorUnaryFunc *cast[NPY_NTYPES];
        PyArray_GetItemFunc *getitem;
        PyArray_SetItemFunc *setitem;
        PyArray_CopySwapNFunc *copyswapn;
        PyArray_CopySwapFunc *copyswap;
        PyArray_CompareFunc *compare;
        PyArray_ArgFunc *argmax;
        PyArray_DotFunc *dotfunc;
        PyArray_ScanFunc *scanfunc;
        PyArray_FromStrFunc *fromstr;
        PyArray_NonzeroFunc *nonzero;
        PyArray_FillFunc *fill;
        PyArray_FillWithScalarFunc *fillwithscalar;
        PyArray_SortFunc *sort[NPY_NSORTS];
        PyArray_ArgSortFunc *argsort[NPY_NSORTS];
        PyObject *castdict;
        PyArray_ScalarKindFunc *scalarkind;
        int **cancastscalarkindto;
        int *cancastto;
        PyArray_FastClipFunc *fastclip;
        PyArray_FastPutmaskFunc *fastputmask;
        PyArray_FastTakeFunc *fasttake;
        PyArray_ArgFunc *argmin;
    } PyArray_ArrFuncs;
    ```

    The concept of a behaved segment is used in the description of the
    function pointers. A behaved segment is one that is aligned and in
    native machine byte-order for the data-type. The ``nonzero``,
    ``copyswap``, ``copyswapn``, ``getitem``, and ``setitem``
    functions can (and must) deal with mis-behaved arrays. The other
    functions require behaved memory segments.

- void ``cast``(void  *\*from* , void  *\*to* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n* , void  *\*fromarr* , void  *\*toarr* )

    An array of function pointers to cast from the current type to
    all of the other builtin types. Each function casts a
    contiguous, aligned, and notswapped buffer pointed at by
    *from*  to a contiguous, aligned, and notswapped buffer pointed
    at by  *to*  The number of items to cast is given by  *n* , and
    the arguments  *fromarr*  and  *toarr*  are interpreted as
    PyArrayObjects for flexible arrays to get itemsize
    information.

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``getitem``(void  *\*data* , void  *\*arr* )

    A pointer to a function that returns a standard Python object
    from a single element of the array object  *arr*  pointed to by
    *data* . This function must be able to deal with “misbehaved
    “(misaligned and/or swapped) arrays correctly.

- int ``setitem``([PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject)  *\*item* , void  *\*data* , void  *\*arr* )

    A pointer to a function that sets the Python object  *item* 
    into the array,  *arr* , at the position pointed to by  *data* 
    . This function deals with “misbehaved” arrays. If successful,
    a zero is returned, otherwise, a negative one is returned (and
    a Python error set).

- void ``copyswapn``(void  *\*dest* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *dstride* , void  *\*src* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *sstride* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n* , int  *swap* , void  *\*arr* )

- void ``copyswap``(void  *\*dest* , void  *\*src* , int  *swap* , void  *\*arr* )[¶](#c.PyArray_ArrFuncs.copyswap)

    These members are both pointers to functions to copy data from
    *src*  to  *dest*  and  *swap*  if indicated. The value of arr is
    only used for flexible ( [``NPY_STRING``](dtype.html#c.NPY_STRING), [``NPY_UNICODE``](dtype.html#c.NPY_UNICODE),
    and [``NPY_VOID``](dtype.html#c.NPY_VOID) ) arrays (and is obtained from
    ``arr->descr->elsize`` ). The second function copies a single
    value, while the first loops over n values with the provided
    strides. These functions can deal with misbehaved  *src* 
    data. If  *src*  is NULL then no copy is performed. If  *swap*  is
    0, then no byteswapping occurs. It is assumed that  *dest*  and
    *src*  do not overlap. If they overlap, then use ``memmove``
    (…) first followed by ``copyswap(n)`` with NULL valued
    ``src``.

- int ``compare``(const void*  *d1* , const void*  *d2* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that compares two elements of the
    array, ``arr``, pointed to by ``d1`` and ``d2``. This
    function requires behaved (aligned and not swapped) arrays.
    The return value is 1 if * ``d1`` > * ``d2``, 0 if * ``d1`` == *
    ``d2``, and -1 if * ``d1`` < * ``d2``. The array object ``arr`` is
    used to retrieve itemsize and field information for flexible arrays.

- int ``argmax``(void*  *data* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)*  *max_ind* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that retrieves the index of the
    largest of ``n`` elements in ``arr`` beginning at the element
    pointed to by ``data``. This function requires that the
    memory segment be contiguous and behaved. The return value is
    always 0. The index of the largest element is returned in
    ``max_ind``.

- void ``dotfunc``(void*  *ip1* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *is1* , void*  *ip2* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *is2* , void*  *op* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that multiplies two ``n`` -length
    sequences together, adds them, and places the result in
    element pointed to by ``op`` of ``arr``. The start of the two
    sequences are pointed to by ``ip1`` and ``ip2``. To get to
    the next element in each sequence requires a jump of ``is1``
    and ``is2``  *bytes* , respectively. This function requires
    behaved (though not necessarily contiguous) memory.

- int ``scanfunc``(FILE*  *fd* , void*  *ip* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that scans (scanf style) one element
    of the corresponding type from the file descriptor ``fd`` into
    the array memory pointed to by ``ip``. The array is assumed
    to be behaved.
    The last argument ``arr`` is the array to be scanned into.
    Returns number of receiving arguments successfully assigned (which
    may be zero in case a matching failure occurred before the first
    receiving argument was assigned), or EOF if input failure occurs
    before the first receiving argument was assigned.
    This function should be called without holding the Python GIL, and
    has to grab it for error reporting.

- int ``fromstr``(char*  *str* , void*  *ip* , char**  *endptr* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that converts the string pointed to by
    ``str`` to one element of the corresponding type and places it
    in the memory location pointed to by ``ip``. After the
    conversion is completed, ``*endptr`` points to the rest of the
    string. The last argument ``arr`` is the array into which ip
    points (needed for variable-size data- types). Returns 0 on
    success or -1 on failure. Requires a behaved array.
    This function should be called without holding the Python GIL, and
    has to grab it for error reporting.

- Bool ``nonzero``(void*  *data* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that returns TRUE if the item of
    ``arr`` pointed to by ``data`` is nonzero. This function can
    deal with misbehaved arrays.

- void ``fill``(void*  *data* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *length* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that fills a contiguous array of given
    length with data. The first two elements of the array must
    already be filled- in. From these two values, a delta will be
    computed and the values from item 3 to the end will be
    computed by repeatedly adding this computed delta. The data
    buffer must be well-behaved.

- void ``fillwithscalar``(void*  *buffer* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *length* , void*  *value* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that fills a contiguous ``buffer`` of
    the given ``length`` with a single scalar ``value`` whose
    address is given. The final argument is the array which is
    needed to get the itemsize for variable-length arrays.

- int ``sort``(void*  *start* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *length* , void*  *arr* )

    An array of function pointers to a particular sorting
    algorithms. A particular sorting algorithm is obtained using a
    key (so far [``NPY_QUICKSORT``](array.html#c.NPY_QUICKSORT), [``NPY_HEAPSORT``](array.html#c.NPY_HEAPSORT),
    and [``NPY_MERGESORT``](array.html#c.NPY_MERGESORT) are defined). These sorts are done
    in-place assuming contiguous and aligned data.

- int ``argsort``(void*  *start* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)*  *result* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *length* , void  *\*arr* )

    An array of function pointers to sorting algorithms for this
    data type. The same sorting algorithms as for sort are
    available. The indices producing the sort are returned in
    ``result`` (which must be initialized with indices 0 to
    ``length-1`` inclusive).

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``castdict``

    Either ``NULL`` or a dictionary containing low-level casting
    functions for user- defined data-types. Each function is
    wrapped in a ``PyCObject *`` and keyed by the data-type number.

- [NPY_SCALARKIND](array.html#c.NPY_SCALARKIND) ``scalarkind``([PyArrayObject](#c.PyArrayObject)*  *arr* )

    A function to determine how scalars of this type should be
    interpreted. The argument is ``NULL`` or a 0-dimensional array
    containing the data (if that is needed to determine the kind
    of scalar). The return value must be of type
    [``NPY_SCALARKIND``](array.html#c.NPY_SCALARKIND).

- int **``cancastscalarkindto``

    Either ``NULL`` or an array of [``NPY_NSCALARKINDS``](array.html#c.NPY_NSCALARKINDS)
    pointers. These pointers should each be either ``NULL`` or a
    pointer to an array of integers (terminated by
    [``NPY_NOTYPE``](dtype.html#c.NPY_NOTYPE)) indicating data-types that a scalar of
    this data-type of the specified kind can be cast to safely
    (this usually means without losing precision).

- int *``cancastto``

    Either ``NULL`` or an array of integers (terminated by
    [``NPY_NOTYPE``](dtype.html#c.NPY_NOTYPE) ) indicated data-types that this data-type
    can be cast to safely (this usually means without losing
    precision).

- void ``fastclip``(void  *\*in* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n_in* , void  *\*min* , void  *\*max* , void  *\*out* )

    A function that reads ``n_in`` items from ``in``, and writes to
    ``out`` the read value if it is within the limits pointed to by
    ``min`` and ``max``, or the corresponding limit if outside. The
    memory segments must be contiguous and behaved, and either
    ``min`` or ``max`` may be ``NULL``, but not both.

- void ``fastputmask``(void  *\*in* , void  *\*mask* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n_in* , void  *\*values* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *nv* )

    A function that takes a pointer ``in`` to an array of ``n_in``
    items, a pointer ``mask`` to an array of ``n_in`` boolean
    values, and a pointer ``vals`` to an array of ``nv`` items.
    Items from ``vals`` are copied into ``in`` wherever the value
    in ``mask`` is non-zero, tiling ``vals`` as needed if
    ``nv < n_in``. All arrays must be contiguous and behaved.

- void ``fasttake``(void  *\*dest* , void  *\*src* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *\*indarray* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *nindarray* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n_outer* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *m_middle* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *nelem* , [NPY_CLIPMODE](array.html#c.NPY_CLIPMODE)  *clipmode* )

    A function that takes a pointer ``src`` to a C contiguous,
    behaved segment, interpreted as a 3-dimensional array of shape
    ``(n_outer, nindarray, nelem)``, a pointer ``indarray`` to a
    contiguous, behaved segment of ``m_middle`` integer indices,
    and a pointer ``dest`` to a C contiguous, behaved segment,
    interpreted as a 3-dimensional array of shape
    ``(n_outer, m_middle, nelem)``. The indices in ``indarray`` are
    used to index ``src`` along the second dimension, and copy the
    corresponding chunks of ``nelem`` items into ``dest``.
    ``clipmode`` (which can take on the values [``NPY_RAISE``](array.html#c.NPY_RAISE),
    [``NPY_WRAP``](array.html#c.NPY_WRAP) or [``NPY_CLIP``](array.html#c.NPY_CLIP)) determines how will
    indices smaller than 0 or larger than ``nindarray`` will be
    handled.

- int ``argmin``(void*  *data* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)  *n* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)*  *min_ind* , void*  *arr* )

    A pointer to a function that retrieves the index of the
    smallest of ``n`` elements in ``arr`` beginning at the element
    pointed to by ``data``. This function requires that the
    memory segment be contiguous and behaved. The return value is
    always 0. The index of the smallest element is returned in
    ``min_ind``.

The [``PyArray_Type``](#c.PyArray_Type) typeobject implements many of the features of
[``Python objects``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/type.html#c.PyTypeObject) including the [``tp_as_number``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_as_number), [``tp_as_sequence``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_as_sequence), [``tp_as_mapping``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_as_mapping), and [``tp_as_buffer``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_as_buffer) interfaces. The [``rich comparison``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.richcmpfunc)) is also used along with new-style attribute lookup for
member ([``tp_members``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_members)) and properties
([``tp_getset``](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/typeobj.html#c.PyTypeObject.tp_getset)).
The [``PyArray_Type``](#c.PyArray_Type) can also be sub-typed.

::: tip Tip

The ``tp_as_number`` methods use a generic approach to call whatever
function has been registered for handling the operation.  When the
``_multiarray_umath module`` is imported, it sets the numeric operations
for all arrays to the corresponding ufuncs. This choice can be changed with
[``PyUFunc_ReplaceLoopBySignature``](ufunc.html#c.PyUFunc_ReplaceLoopBySignature) The ``tp_str`` and ``tp_repr``
methods can also be altered using [``PyArray_SetStringFunction``](array.html#c.PyArray_SetStringFunction).

### PyUFunc_Type and PyUFuncObject

- ``PyUFunc_Type``

    The ufunc object is implemented by creation of the
    [``PyUFunc_Type``](#c.PyUFunc_Type). It is a very simple type that implements only
    basic getattribute behavior, printing behavior, and has call
    behavior which allows these objects to act like functions. The
    basic idea behind the ufunc is to hold a reference to fast
    1-dimensional (vector) loops for each data type that supports the
    operation. These one-dimensional loops all have the same signature
    and are the key to creating a new ufunc. They are called by the
    generic looping code as appropriate to implement the N-dimensional
    function. There are also some generic 1-d loops defined for
    floating and complexfloating arrays that allow you to define a
    ufunc using a single scalar function ( *e.g.*  atanh).

- ``PyUFuncObject``

    The core of the ufunc is the [``PyUFuncObject``](#c.PyUFuncObject) which contains all
    the information needed to call the underlying C-code loops that
    perform the actual work. While it is described here for completeness, it
    should be considered internal to NumPy and manipulated via ``PyUFunc_*``
    functions. The size of this structure is subject to change across versions
    of NumPy. To ensure compatibility:

    - Never declare a non-pointer instance of the struct
    - Never perform pointer arithmetic
    - Never use ``sizeof(PyUFuncObject)``

    It has the following structure:

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyObject_HEAD
        int nin;
        int nout;
        int nargs;
        int identity;
        PyUFuncGenericFunction *functions;
        void **data;
        int ntypes;
        int reserved1;
        const char *name;
        char *types;
        const char *doc;
        void *ptr;
        PyObject *obj;
        PyObject *userloops;
        int core_enabled;
        int core_num_dim_ix;
        int *core_num_dims;
        int *core_dim_ixs;
        int *core_offsets;
        char *core_signature;
        PyUFunc_TypeResolutionFunc *type_resolver;
        PyUFunc_LegacyInnerLoopSelectionFunc *legacy_inner_loop_selector;
        PyUFunc_MaskedInnerLoopSelectionFunc *masked_inner_loop_selector;
        npy_uint32 *op_flags;
        npy_uint32 *iter_flags;
        /* new in API version 0x0000000D */
        npy_intp *core_dim_sizes;
        npy_intp *core_dim_flags;

    } PyUFuncObject;
    ```

- int ``PyUFuncObject.nin``

    The number of input arguments.

- int ``PyUFuncObject.nout``

    The number of output arguments.

- int ``PyUFuncObject.nargs``

    The total number of arguments ( *nin*  +  *nout* ). This must be less than [``NPY_MAXARGS``](array.html#c.NPY_MAXARGS).

- int ``PyUFuncObject.identity``

    Either [``PyUFunc_One``](ufunc.html#c.PyUFunc_One), [``PyUFunc_Zero``](ufunc.html#c.PyUFunc_Zero),
    [``PyUFunc_None``](ufunc.html#c.PyUFunc_None) or ``PyUFunc_AllOnes`` to indicate
    the identity for this operation. It is only used for a
    reduce-like call on an empty array.

- void ``PyUFuncObject.functions``(char**  *args* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)*  *dims* , [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)*  *steps* , void*  *extradata* )

    An array of function pointers — one for each data type
    supported by the ufunc. This is the vector loop that is called
    to implement the underlying function  *dims*  [0] times. The
    first argument,  *args* , is an array of  *nargs*  pointers to
    behaved memory. Pointers to the data for the input arguments
    are first, followed by the pointers to the data for the output
    arguments. How many bytes must be skipped to get to the next
    element in the sequence is specified by the corresponding entry
    in the  *steps*  array. The last argument allows the loop to
    receive extra information.  This is commonly used so that a
    single, generic vector loop can be used for multiple
    functions. In this case, the actual scalar function to call is
    passed in as  *extradata* . The size of this function pointer
    array is ntypes.

- void **``PyUFuncObject.data``

    Extra data to be passed to the 1-d vector loops or ``NULL`` if
    no extra-data is needed. This C-array must be the same size (
    *i.e.*  ntypes) as the functions array. ``NULL`` is used if
    extra_data is not needed. Several C-API calls for UFuncs are
    just 1-d vector loops that make use of this extra data to
    receive a pointer to the actual function to call.

- int ``PyUFuncObject.ntypes``

    The number of supported data types for the ufunc. This number
    specifies how many different 1-d loops (of the builtin data
    types) are available.

- int ``PyUFuncObject.reserved1``

    Unused.

- char *``PyUFuncObject.name``

    A string name for the ufunc. This is used dynamically to build
    the __doc__ attribute of ufuncs.

- char *``PyUFuncObject.types``

    An array of  8-bit type_numbers
    which contains the type signature for the function for each of
    the supported (builtin) data types. For each of the  *ntypes* 
    functions, the corresponding set of type numbers in this array
    shows how the  *args*  argument should be interpreted in the 1-d
    vector loop. These type numbers do not have to be the same type
    and mixed-type ufuncs are supported.

- char *``PyUFuncObject.doc``

    Documentation for the ufunc. Should not contain the function
    signature as this is generated dynamically when __doc__ is
    retrieved.

- void *``PyUFuncObject.ptr``

    Any dynamically allocated memory. Currently, this is used for
    dynamic ufuncs created from a python function to store room for
    the types, data, and name members.

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyUFuncObject.obj``

    For ufuncs dynamically created from python functions, this member
    holds a reference to the underlying Python function.

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyUFuncObject.userloops``

    A dictionary of user-defined 1-d vector loops (stored as CObject
    ptrs) for user-defined types. A loop may be registered by the
    user for any user-defined type. It is retrieved by type number.
    User defined type numbers are always larger than
    [``NPY_USERDEF``](dtype.html#c.NPY_USERDEF).

- int ``PyUFuncObject.core_enabled``

    0 for scalar ufuncs; 1 for generalized ufuncs

- int ``PyUFuncObject.core_num_dim_ix``

    Number of distinct core dimension names in the signature

- int *``PyUFuncObject.core_num_dims``

    Number of core dimensions of each argument

- int *``PyUFuncObject.core_dim_ixs``

    Dimension indices in a flattened form; indices of argument ``k`` are
    stored in ``core_dim_ixs[core_offsets[k] : core_offsets[k] +
    core_numdims[k]]``

- int *``PyUFuncObject.core_offsets``

    Position of 1st core dimension of each argument in ``core_dim_ixs``,
    equivalent to cumsum(``core_num_dims``)

- char *``PyUFuncObject.core_signature``

    Core signature string

- PyUFunc_TypeResolutionFunc *``PyUFuncObject.type_resolver``

    A function which resolves the types and fills an array with the dtypes
    for the inputs and outputs

- PyUFunc_LegacyInnerLoopSelectionFunc *``PyUFuncObject.legacy_inner_loop_selector``

    A function which returns an inner loop. The ``legacy`` in the name arises
    because for NumPy 1.6 a better variant had been planned. This variant
    has not yet come about.

- void *``PyUFuncObject.reserved2``

    For a possible future loop selector with a different signature.

- PyUFunc_MaskedInnerLoopSelectionFunc *``PyUFuncObject.masked_inner_loop_selector``

    Function which returns a masked inner loop for the ufunc

- [npy_uint32](dtype.html#c.npy_uint32) ``PyUFuncObject.op_flags``

    Override the default operand flags for each ufunc operand.

- [npy_uint32](dtype.html#c.npy_uint32) ``PyUFuncObject.iter_flags``

    Override the default nditer flags for the ufunc.

Added in API version 0x0000000D

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyUFuncObject.core_dim_sizes``

    For each distinct core dimension, the possible [frozen](generalized-ufuncs.html#frozen) size if ``UFUNC_CORE_DIM_SIZE_INFERRED`` is 0

- [npy_uint32](dtype.html#c.npy_uint32) *``PyUFuncObject.core_dim_flags``[¶](#c.PyUFuncObject.PyUFuncObject.core_dim_flags)

    For each distinct core dimension, a set of ``UFUNC_CORE_DIM*`` flags

    - ``UFUNC_CORE_DIM_CAN_IGNORE`` if the dim name ends in ``?``
    - ``UFUNC_CORE_DIM_SIZE_INFERRED`` if the dim size will be determined from the operands and not from a [frozen](generalized-ufuncs.html#frozen) signature

### PyArrayIter_Type and PyArrayIterObject

- ``PyArrayIter_Type``

    This is an iterator object that makes it easy to loop over an
    N-dimensional array. It is the object returned from the flat
    attribute of an ndarray. It is also used extensively throughout the
    implementation internals to loop over an N-dimensional array. The
    tp_as_mapping interface is implemented so that the iterator object
    can be indexed (using 1-d indexing), and a few methods are
    implemented through the tp_methods table. This object implements the
    next method and can be used anywhere an iterator can be used in
    Python.

- ``PyArrayIterObject``

    The C-structure corresponding to an object of [``PyArrayIter_Type``](#c.PyArrayIter_Type) is
    the [``PyArrayIterObject``](#c.PyArrayIterObject). The [``PyArrayIterObject``](#c.PyArrayIterObject) is used to
    keep track of a pointer into an N-dimensional array. It contains associated
    information used to quickly march through the array. The pointer can
    be adjusted in three basic ways: 1) advance to the “next” position in
    the array in a C-style contiguous fashion, 2) advance to an arbitrary
    N-dimensional coordinate in the array, and 3) advance to an arbitrary
    one-dimensional index into the array. The members of the
    [``PyArrayIterObject``](#c.PyArrayIterObject) structure are used in these
    calculations. Iterator objects keep their own dimension and strides
    information about an array. This can be adjusted as needed for
    “broadcasting,” or to loop over only specific dimensions.

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyObject_HEAD
        int   nd_m1;
        npy_intp  index;
        npy_intp  size;
        npy_intp  coordinates[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp  dims_m1[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp  strides[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp  backstrides[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp  factors[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        PyArrayObject *ao;
        char  *dataptr;
        Bool  contiguous;
    } PyArrayIterObject;
    ```

- int ``PyArrayIterObject.nd_m1``[¶](#c.PyArrayIterObject.PyArrayIterObject.nd_m1)

    <img class="math" src="/static/images/math/6e5bd910d2a98f9a975a4078ea3258c7be8992bf.svg" alt="N-1"> where <img class="math" src="/static/images/math/f4170ed8938b79490d8923857962695514a8e4cb.svg" alt="N"> is the number of dimensions in the
    underlying array.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) ``PyArrayIterObject.index``

    The current 1-d index into the array.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) ``PyArrayIterObject.size``

    The total size of the underlying array.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayIterObject.coordinates``

    An  -dimensional index into the array.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayIterObject.dims_m1``

    The size of the array minus 1 in each dimension.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayIterObject.strides``

    The strides of the array. How many bytes needed to jump to the next
    element in each dimension.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayIterObject.backstrides``

    How many bytes needed to jump from the end of a dimension back
    to its beginning. Note that ``backstrides[k] == strides[k] *
    dims_m1[k]``, but it is stored here as an optimization.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayIterObject.factors``

    This array is used in computing an N-d index from a 1-d index. It
    contains needed products of the dimensions.

- [PyArrayObject](#c.PyArrayObject) *``PyArrayIterObject.ao``

    A pointer to the underlying ndarray this iterator was created to
    represent.

- char *``PyArrayIterObject.dataptr``

    This member points to an element in the ndarray indicated by the
    index.

- Bool ``PyArrayIterObject.contiguous``

    This flag is true if the underlying array is
    [``NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS). It is used to simplify
    calculations when possible.

How to use an array iterator on a C-level is explained more fully in
later sections. Typically, you do not need to concern yourself with
the internal structure of the iterator object, and merely interact
with it through the use of the macros [``PyArray_ITER_NEXT``](array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_NEXT) (it),
[``PyArray_ITER_GOTO``](array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_GOTO) (it, dest), or [``PyArray_ITER_GOTO1D``](array.html#c.PyArray_ITER_GOTO1D)
(it, index). All of these macros require the argument  *it*  to be a
[``PyArrayIterObject *``](#c.PyArrayIterObject).

### PyArrayMultiIter_Type and PyArrayMultiIterObject

- ``PyArrayMultiIter_Type``

    This type provides an iterator that encapsulates the concept of
    broadcasting. It allows  arrays to be broadcast together
    so that the loop progresses in C-style contiguous fashion over the
    broadcasted array. The corresponding C-structure is the
    [``PyArrayMultiIterObject``](#c.PyArrayMultiIterObject) whose memory layout must begin any
    object,  *obj* , passed in to the [``PyArray_Broadcast``](array.html#c.PyArray_Broadcast) (obj)
    function. Broadcasting is performed by adjusting array iterators so
    that each iterator represents the broadcasted shape and size, but
    has its strides adjusted so that the correct element from the array
    is used at each iteration.

- ``PyArrayMultiIterObject``

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyObject_HEAD
        int numiter;
        npy_intp size;
        npy_intp index;
        int nd;
        npy_intp dimensions[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        PyArrayIterObject *iters[NPY_MAXDIMS];
    } PyArrayMultiIterObject;
    ```

- int ``PyArrayMultiIterObject.numiter``

    The number of arrays that need to be broadcast to the same shape.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) ``PyArrayMultiIterObject.size``

    The total broadcasted size.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) ``PyArrayMultiIterObject.index``

    The current (1-d) index into the broadcasted result.

- int ``PyArrayMultiIterObject.nd``

    The number of dimensions in the broadcasted result.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayMultiIterObject.dimensions``

    The shape of the broadcasted result (only ``nd`` slots are used).

- [PyArrayIterObject](#c.PyArrayIterObject) **``PyArrayMultiIterObject.iters`` 

    An array of iterator objects that holds the iterators for the
    arrays to be broadcast together. On return, the iterators are
    adjusted for broadcasting.

### PyArrayNeighborhoodIter_Type and PyArrayNeighborhoodIterObject

- ``PyArrayNeighborhoodIter_Type``

    This is an iterator object that makes it easy to loop over an
    N-dimensional neighborhood.

- ``PyArrayNeighborhoodIterObject``

    The C-structure corresponding to an object of
    [``PyArrayNeighborhoodIter_Type``](#c.PyArrayNeighborhoodIter_Type) is the
    [``PyArrayNeighborhoodIterObject``](#c.PyArrayNeighborhoodIterObject).

    ``` c
    typedef struct {
        PyObject_HEAD
        int nd_m1;
        npy_intp index, size;
        npy_intp coordinates[NPY_MAXDIMS]
        npy_intp dims_m1[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp strides[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp backstrides[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_intp factors[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        PyArrayObject *ao;
        char *dataptr;
        npy_bool contiguous;
        npy_intp bounds[NPY_MAXDIMS][2];
        npy_intp limits[NPY_MAXDIMS][2];
        npy_intp limits_sizes[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        npy_iter_get_dataptr_t translate;
        npy_intp nd;
        npy_intp dimensions[NPY_MAXDIMS];
        PyArrayIterObject* _internal_iter;
        char* constant;
        int mode;
    } PyArrayNeighborhoodIterObject;
    ```

### PyArrayFlags_Type and PyArrayFlagsObject


- ``PyArrayFlags_Type``

    When the flags attribute is retrieved from Python, a special
    builtin object of this type is constructed. This special type makes
    it easier to work with the different flags by accessing them as
    attributes or by accessing them as if the object were a dictionary
    with the flag names as entries.

- ``PyArrayFlagsObject``

    ``` c
    typedef struct PyArrayFlagsObject {
            PyObject_HEAD
            PyObject *arr;
            int flags;
    } PyArrayFlagsObject;
    ```

### ScalarArrayTypes

There is a Python type for each of the different built-in data types
that can be present in the array Most of these are simple wrappers
around the corresponding data type in C. The C-names for these types
are ``Py{TYPE}ArrType_Type`` where ``{TYPE}`` can be

```
Bool, Byte, Short, Int, Long, LongLong, UByte, UShort, UInt, ULong, ULongLong, Half, Float, Double, LongDouble, CFloat, CDouble, CLongDouble, String, Unicode, Void, and Object.
```

These type names are part of the C-API and can therefore be created in
extension C-code. There is also a ``PyIntpArrType_Type`` and a
``PyUIntpArrType_Type`` that are simple substitutes for one of the
integer types that can hold a pointer on the platform. The structure
of these scalar objects is not exposed to C-code. The function
[``PyArray_ScalarAsCtype``](array.html#c.PyArray_ScalarAsCtype) (..) can be used to extract the C-type
value from the array scalar and the function [``PyArray_Scalar``](array.html#c.PyArray_Scalar)
(…) can be used to construct an array scalar from a C-value.

## Other C-Structures

A few new C-structures were found to be useful in the development of
NumPy. These C-structures are used in at least one C-API call and are
therefore documented here. The main reason these structures were
defined is to make it easy to use the Python ParseTuple C-API to
convert from Python objects to a useful C-Object.

### PyArray_Dims

This structure is very useful when shape and/or strides information
is supposed to be interpreted. The structure is:

``` c
typedef struct {
    npy_intp *ptr;
    int len;
} PyArray_Dims;
```

The members of this structure are

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArray_Dims.ptr``

    A pointer to a list of ([``npy_intp``](dtype.html#c.npy_intp)) integers which
    usually represent array shape or array strides.

- int ``PyArray_Dims.len``

    The length of the list of integers. It is assumed safe to
    access  *ptr*  [0] to  *ptr*  [len-1].

### PyArray_Chunk

This is equivalent to the buffer object structure in Python up to
the ptr member. On 32-bit platforms ( *i.e.*  if [``NPY_SIZEOF_INT``](config.html#c.NPY_SIZEOF_INT)
== ``NPY_SIZEOF_INTP``), the len member also matches an equivalent
member of the buffer object. It is useful to represent a generic
single-segment chunk of memory.

``` c
typedef struct {
  PyObject_HEAD
  PyObject *base;
  void *ptr;
  npy_intp len;
  int flags;
} PyArray_Chunk;
```

The members are

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArray_Chunk.base``

  The Python object this chunk of memory comes from. Needed so that
  memory can be accounted for properly.

- void *``PyArray_Chunk.ptr``

  A pointer to the start of the single-segment chunk of memory.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) ``PyArray_Chunk.len``

  The length of the segment in bytes.

- int ``PyArray_Chunk.flags``

  Any data flags ( *e.g.*  [``NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE) ) that should
  be used to interpret the memory.

### PyArrayInterface

::: tip See also

[The Array Interface](https://numpy.org/devdocs/arrays.interface.html#arrays-interface)

:::

The [``PyArrayInterface``](#c.PyArrayInterface) structure is defined so that NumPy and
other extension modules can use the rapid array interface
protocol. The ``__array_struct__`` method of an object that
supports the rapid array interface protocol should return a
``PyCObject`` that contains a pointer to a [``PyArrayInterface``](#c.PyArrayInterface)
structure with the relevant details of the array. After the new
array is created, the attribute should be ``DECREF``’d which will
free the [``PyArrayInterface``](#c.PyArrayInterface) structure. Remember to ``INCREF`` the
object (whose ``__array_struct__`` attribute was retrieved) and
point the base member of the new [``PyArrayObject``](#c.PyArrayObject) to this same
object. In this way the memory for the array will be managed
correctly.

``` c
typedef struct {
    int two;
    int nd;
    char typekind;
    int itemsize;
    int flags;
    npy_intp *shape;
    npy_intp *strides;
    void *data;
    PyObject *descr;
} PyArrayInterface;
```

- int ``PyArrayInterface.two``

    the integer 2 as a sanity check.

- int ``PyArrayInterface.nd``

    the number of dimensions in the array.

- char ``PyArrayInterface.typekind``

    A character indicating what kind of array is present according to the
    typestring convention with ‘t’ -> bitfield, ‘b’ -> Boolean, ‘i’ ->
    signed integer, ‘u’ -> unsigned integer, ‘f’ -> floating point, ‘c’ ->
    complex floating point, ‘O’ -> object, ‘S’ -> (byte-)string, ‘U’ ->
    unicode, ‘V’ -> void.

- int ``PyArrayInterface.itemsize``

    The number of bytes each item in the array requires.

- int ``PyArrayInterface.flags``

    Any of the bits [``NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS) (1),
    [``NPY_ARRAY_F_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_F_CONTIGUOUS) (2), [``NPY_ARRAY_ALIGNED``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_ALIGNED) (0x100),
    [``NPY_ARRAY_NOTSWAPPED``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_NOTSWAPPED) (0x200), or [``NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_WRITEABLE)
    (0x400) to indicate something about the data. The
    [``NPY_ARRAY_ALIGNED``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_ALIGNED), [``NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_C_CONTIGUOUS), and
    [``NPY_ARRAY_F_CONTIGUOUS``](array.html#c.NPY_ARRAY_F_CONTIGUOUS) flags can actually be determined from
    the other parameters. The flag ``NPY_ARR_HAS_DESCR``
    (0x800) can also be set to indicate to objects consuming the
    version 3 array interface that the descr member of the
    structure is present (it will be ignored by objects consuming
    version 2 of the array interface).

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayInterface.shape``

    An array containing the size of the array in each dimension.

- [npy_intp](dtype.html#c.npy_intp) *``PyArrayInterface.strides``

    An array containing the number of bytes to jump to get to the next
    element in each dimension.

- void *``PyArrayInterface.data``

    A pointer  *to*  the first element of the array.

- [PyObject](https://docs.python.org/dev/c-api/structures.html#c.PyObject) *``PyArrayInterface.descr``

    A Python object describing the data-type in more detail (same
    as the  *descr*  key in [``__array_interface__``](https://numpy.org/devdocs/arrays.interface.html#__array_interface__)). This can be
    ``NULL`` if  *typekind*  and  *itemsize*  provide enough
    information. This field is also ignored unless
    ``ARR_HAS_DESCR`` flag is on in  *flags* .

### Internally used structures

Internally, the code uses some additional Python objects primarily for
memory management. These types are not accessible directly from
Python, and are not exposed to the C-API. They are included here only
for completeness and assistance in understanding the code.

- ``PyUFuncLoopObject``

    A loose wrapper for a C-structure that contains the information
    needed for looping. This is useful if you are trying to understand
    the ufunc looping code. The [``PyUFuncLoopObject``](#c.PyUFuncLoopObject) is the associated
    C-structure. It is defined in the ``ufuncobject.h`` header.

- ``PyUFuncReduceObject``

    A loose wrapper for the C-structure that contains the information
    needed for reduce-like methods of ufuncs. This is useful if you are
    trying to understand the reduce, accumulate, and reduce-at
    code. The [``PyUFuncReduceObject``](#c.PyUFuncReduceObject) is the associated C-structure. It
    is defined in the ``ufuncobject.h`` header.

- ``PyUFunc_Loop1d``

    A simple linked-list of C-structures containing the information needed
    to define a 1-d loop for a ufunc for every defined signature of a
    user-defined data-type.

- ``PyArrayMapIter_Type``

    Advanced indexing is handled with this Python type. It is simply a
    loose wrapper around the C-structure containing the variables
    needed for advanced array indexing. The associated C-structure,
    ``PyArrayMapIterObject``, is useful if you are trying to
    understand the advanced-index mapping code. It is defined in the
    ``arrayobject.h`` header. This type is not exposed to Python and
    could be replaced with a C-structure. As a Python type it takes
    advantage of reference- counted memory management.
